# KNN-with-NCV-from-scratch-
Developing a KNN without the use of scikit learn libraries and implementing Nested cross validation (NCV), and evaluating the different hyper-parameters using confusion matrices and metrics. 

The project also examines: 
- Feature selection on the Wine Dataset 
- Influence of noise on feature selection and classsifier evaluation 
- Compares the algortihm to the SCIKIT Learn
